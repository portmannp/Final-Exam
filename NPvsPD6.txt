What is the difference between a numpy array and a pandas dataframe in 
Python?

In a numpy array all the "items" in the array are of the same type. 

Adding to a pandas DataFrame is a lot easier than adding to an numpy 
array because the indexing in a DataFrame is more flexible whereas 
inserting in toa numpy array you would have to move all the "items" 
behind the insert to a different space in memory which takes a ton of 
time.
